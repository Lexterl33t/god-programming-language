## God - Programming Language

### I am student in Cybersecurity at 2600 school. Being passionate about how programming languages work, I started developing my own language. I called it God (don't ask me why).



```god

fn ->hello[name] {
  print("Hello world")
}

fn -> main[] {
  hello("Bryton")
}
```

### this project is in development
